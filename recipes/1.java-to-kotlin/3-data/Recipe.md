# Data

The [data](../../../java-to-kotlin/src/main/java/nl/alimeshkat/recipes/data) package has two JPA `entities`
and
two `repositories`.
As we have configured `JPA` in the `kotlin-maven-plugin`, only thing we have to do is converting the classes and make
some
small adjustments to the
Kotlin code.

## Recipe

1) Convert the `data` package to Kotlin
2) Refactor the `Entity` classes the following way:
    1) Don't use `data` classes for JPA `entities`, because `entities` are not just regular DTO's!
    2) Add the `entity` properties to the default constructor
    3) Make all properties immutable (`val`)
    4) Make `ingredientId` and `ingridients` nullable
3) There is not much to change in the `Repositories` class, just make the `generic-types` of the
   `JpaRepository` not nullable.
4) For example, after the conversion and refactoring the signature of `IngredientsEntity` class should look like this:

````kotlin
@Entity
@Table(name = "ingredients")
class IngredientsEntity(
    @ManyToOne(optional = false)
    @JoinColumn(name = "recipes_id", nullable = false)
    val recipes: RecipesEntity? = null,
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    val ingredientId: Long? = null,
    val name: String,
    val type: String,
    val weight: Int,
) {.. }
````

5) When ready, run all tests:

```shell
   (cd ../../.. && ./mvnw package -pl :java-to-kotlin)
```

The JPA `Entities` need to
adhere to certain requirement to function properly. Read about the pitfalls of using JPA (Hibernate) with
Kotlin [here](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/blog/best-practices-and-common-pitfalls/).
